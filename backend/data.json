      "fullDescription": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday (August 30, 2025) arrived in China to attend the SCO summit after wrapping up a two-day visit to Japan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday (August 30, 2025) travelled to Sendai in the Japanese prefecture of Miyagi to visit a semiconductor plant. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister urged Japanese governors and Indian state governments to forge stronger collaborations in manufacturing, mobility, next-generation infrastructure, innovation, start-ups and small businesses. During his two-day visit to China, Mr. Modi will attend the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Tianjin on August 31 and September 1.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the 10-member bloc is regarded as significant and most consequential from the point of view of India-China relations in the current context of a sudden downturn in India-U.S. ties after Mr. Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports.",

Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates have joined BRICS as its new members.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is due to meet Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the SCO summit being held here from Sunday to Monday.\r\n\r\nIn the written interview with Xinhua, Mr. Putin said Russia and China support reforming the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\r\n\r\nHe added that the two sides share the view that a new financial system must be built on the principles of \"openness and true equity\", which can provide equal and non-discriminatory access to its tools for all countries and reflect the real standing of member states in the global economy.",
